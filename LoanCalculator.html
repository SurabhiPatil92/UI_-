This is an html table with <input> elements that allow the user to enter data and <span> elements in which program can display results. These elements have ids like "interest","years". These ids are used in the javascript code that follows the table. Note that some of the input elemtntrs define "onchange" or "onclick" event handlers. These specify strings of javascript code to be executed when the user enters data or clicks.
